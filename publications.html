    Tangible Modeling with Open Source GIS</a></h4>
<p><strong>Petrasova, A.</strong>, Harmon, B., Petras, V., Mitasova, H., 2015.
<em>Tangible Modeling with Open Source GIS</em>. Springer International Publishing. doi:10.1007/978-3-319-25775-4
<p class="abstract" style="padding-top:10px;">This book presents a new type of modeling environment where users
 interact with geospatial simulations using 3D physical models of studied landscapes.
 Multiple users can alter the physical model by hand during scanning, thereby providing 
input for simulation of geophysical processes in this setting.
The authors have developed innovative techniques and software that couple this hardware
 with open source GRASS GIS, making the system instantly applicable to a wide range of
 modeling and design problems. Since no other literature on this topic is available,
 this book fills a gap for this new technology that continues to grow.
Tangible Modeling with Open Source GIS will appeal to advanced-level students studying 
geospatial science, computer science and earth science such as  landscape architecture and natural resources. It will also benefit researchers and professionals  working in geospatial modeling applications, computer graphics, hazard risk management, hydrology, solar energy, coastal and fluvial flooding, fire spread, landscape, park design and computer games.

        <p class="abstract" style="padding-top:10px;">
            New technologies for terrain reconstruction have increased the availability of topographic data
            at a broad range of resolutions and spatial extents.
            The existing digital elevation models (DEMs) can now be 
            updated at a low cost in selected study areas with newer,
            often higher resolution data using unmanned aerial systems (UAS) or terrestrial sensors.
            However, differences in spatial coverage and levels of detail often
            create discontinuities along the newly mapped area boundaries and subsequently lead to artifacts in results of DEM
            analyses or models of landscape processes.
            To generate a seamless updated DEM, we propose a generalized approach to DEM fusion with a smooth transition
            while preserving important topographic features. The transition is controlled by distance-based weighted
            averaging along the DEMs' blending overlap with spatially variable width based on elevation differences.
            We demonstrate the method on two case studies exploring the effects of DEM fusion on water flow modeling
            in the context of precision agriculture. 
            In the first case study,
            we update a lidar-based DEM with a fused set of two digital surface models (DSMs)
            derived from imagery acquired by UAS.
            In the second application, developed for a 
            tangible geospatial interface, we fuse a georeferenced, physical sand model continuously scanned by a Kinect sensor with a lidar-based DEM 
            of the surrounding watershed in order to computationally simulate and test methods for controlling storm water flow.
            The results of our experiments demonstrate the importance of seamless,
            robust fusion for realistic simulation of water flow patterns using multiple high-resolution DEMs.

        <p class="abstract" style="padding-top:10px;">
Managing landscape-scale environmental problems, such as biological invasions,
can be facilitated by integrating realistic geospatial models with
user-friendly interfaces that stakeholders can use to make critical management
decisions. However, gaps between scientific theory and application have
typically limited opportunities for model-based knowledge to reach the
stakeholders responsible for problem-solving. To address this challenge,
we introduce Tangible Landscape, an open-source participatory modeling
tool providing an interactive, shared arena for consensus-building and
development of collaborative solutions for landscape-scale problems.
Using Tangible Landscape, stakeholders gather around a geographically
realistic 3D visualization and explore management scenarios with instant
feedback; users direct model simulations with intuitive tangible gestures
and compare alternative strategies with an output dashboard. We applied
Tangible Landscape to the complex problem of managing the emerging infectious
disease, sudden oak death, in California and explored its potential to
generate co-learning and collaborative management strategies among actors
representing stakeholders with competing management aims.

        Forecasts of urbanization scenarios reveal trade-offs between landscape change and ecosystem services</a></h4>

    <em>Forecasts of urbanization scenarios reveal trade-offs between landscape change and ecosystem services</em>. Landscape Ecology, 1-18.
    <p class="abstract" style="padding-top:10px;">
        Expansion of urban settlements has caused
observed declines in ecosystem services (ES) globally,
further stressing the need for informed urban development
and policies. Incorporating ES concepts into
the decision making process has been shown to
support resilient and functional ecosystems. Coupling
land change and ES models allows for insights into the
impacts and anticipated trade-offs of specific policy
decisions. The spatial configuration of urbanization
likely influences the delivery and production of ES.
When considering multiple ES simultaneously,
improving the production of one ecosystem
service often results in the decrease in the provision of
other ES, giving rise to trade-offs. We examine the
impact of three urban growth scenarios on several ES
to determine the degree to which spatial configuration
of urbanization and the development of natural land
cover impacts these services over 25 years.
We couple land change and ES models to
examine impacts to carbon sequestration, surface
water-run off, nitrogen and phosphorus export, organic
farming and camping site suitability, to determine
trade-offs among the six ES associated with each
spatial configuration for western North Carolina.
Consequences of urban configurations are
dramatic, with degraded ES across all scenarios and
substantial variation depending on urban pattern,
revealing trade-offs. Counter-intuitive trade-offs
between carbon sequestration and lands available for
organic farming and camping were observed, suggesting
that no configurations result in mutual benefits for
all ES.
By understanding trade-offs associated
with urban configurations, decision makers can identify
ES critical to an area and promote configurations
that enhance those

    (FUTure Urban – Regional Environment Simulation) – a patch-based,
    stochastic, multi-level land change modeling framework as a case
    showing how what was once a closed and inaccessible model benefited
    from integration with open source GIS.We will describe our motivation
    for releasing this project as open source and the advantages of integrating

    We will describe FUTURES integration into GRASS GIS and demonstrate its usage

<em>Tangible Landscape: Cognitively Grasping the Flow of Water</em>. Int. Arch. Photogramm. Remote Sens. Spatial Inf. Sci., XLI-B2, 647-653.
<p class="abstract" style="padding-top:10px;">
    Complex spatial forms like topography can be challenging to understand,
    much less intentionally shape, given the heavy cognitive load of visualizing
    and manipulating 3D form. Spatiotemporal processes like the flow of water
    over a landscape are even more challenging to understand and intentionally
    direct as they are dependent upon their context and require the simulation
    of forces like gravity and momentum. This cognitive work can be offloaded
    onto computers through 3D geospatial modeling, analysis, and simulation.
    Interacting with computers, however, can also be challenging, often requiring
    training and highly abstract thinking. Tangible computing – an emerging
    paradigm of human-computer interaction in which data is physically
    manifested so that users can feel it and directly manipulate it – aims to
    offload this added cognitive work onto the body. We have designed Tangible
    Landscape, a tangible interface powered by an open source geographic information
    system (GRASS GIS), so that users can naturally shape topography and interact
    with simulated processes with their hands in order to make observations, generate
    and test hypotheses, and make inferences about scientific phenomena in a rapid,
    iterative process. Conceptually Tangible Landscape couples a malleable physical
     model with a digital model of a landscape through a continuous cycle of 3D scanning,
     geospatial modeling, and projection. We ran a flow modeling experiment to test
     whether tangible interfaces like this can effectively enhance spatial performance
     by offloading cognitive processes onto computers and our bodies. We used
     hydrological simulations and statistics to quantitatively assess spatial
     performance. We found that Tangible Landscape enhanced 3D spatial performance
     and helped users understand water flow.

we will demonstrate how development can be planned based on feedback from landscape processes

<strong>Abstract</strong>:
Since traditional subsurface visualizations using 2D maps,
profiles or charts can be difficult to interpret and often
do not convey information in an engaging form, scientists
are interested in developing alternative visualization techniques
which would help them communicate the subsurface volume data with
students and general public. We would like to present new technique
for interactive visualization of subsurface using Tangible geospatial
modeling and visualization system (Tangeoms). It couples a physical,
three-dimensional model with geospatial modeling and analysis through
a cycle of scanning and projection. Previous applications of Tangeoms
were exploring the impact of terrain modifications on surface-based
geophysical processes, such as overland water flow, sediment transport,
and also on viewsheds, cast shadows or solar energy potential.
However, Tangeoms can serve as a tool for exploring subsurface as well.
By creating a physical sand model of a study area, removing the sand
from different parts of the model and projecting the computed cross-sections,
we can look under the ground as if we were at an excavation site, and see
the actual data represented as a 3D raster in that particular part of the model.
Depending on data availability, we can also incorporate temporal dimension.
Our method is an intuitive and natural way of exploring subsurface data
and for users, it represents an alternative to more abstract 3D computer
visualization tools, by offering direct, tangible interface.

  GRASS GIS Vector State of the Art &mdash; Gearing towards GRASS GIS 7</a></h4>
  <p>Metz, M., Landa, M., <strong>Petrasova, A.</strong>, Petras, V., Chemin, Y., Neteler, M. and The GRASS GIS Development Team</p>
  <p class="abstract" style="padding-top:10px;">
  <strong>Abstract:</strong>
   Topology ensures that adjacent geographic components in a single vector map are related.
   In contrast to non-topological GIS, a border common to two areas exists only once and
   is shared between the two areas. Topological representation of vector data helps
   to produce and maintain vector maps with clean geometry as well as enables the
   user to perform certain analyses that can not be conducted with non-topological
   or spaghetti data. Non-topological vector data are automatically converted to a topological
   representation upon import. Further more, various cleaning tools exist to remove non-trivial
   topological errors. In the upcoming GRASS GIS 7 release the vector library was
   particularly improved to make it faster and more efficient with an improved
   internal vector file format. This new topological format reduces memory and disk space
   requirements, leading to a generally faster processing. Opening an existing vector
   requires less memory providing additionally support for large files. The new spatial
   index performs queries faster (compared to GRASS GIS 6 more than 10 times for large vectors).
   As a new option the user can select a file-based version of the spatial index for large vector data.
   All topological cleaning tools have been optimized with regard to processing speed,
   robustness, and system requirements.
   The vector engine comes with a new prototype for direct read/write support
   of OGR Simple Features API. Additionally vector data can be directly exchanged
   with topological PostGIS 2 databases. This enables GRASS to read and write
   topological primitives beside native file-based format also to the topological
   PostGIS 2 databases. Considering the wide spread usage of Esri Shapefile,
   a non-topological format for vector data exchange, it is particularly
   advantageous that GRASS GIS 7 offers advanced cleaning tools.
   For power users and programmers, the new Python interface allows to directly
   access functions provided by the underlying C libraries;
   this combines the ease of writing Python scripts with the power
   of optimized C functionality in the library backend.

            With the increased availability of UAS technologies we can produce extremely high resolution
            3D data as often as we need for monitoring of crops, landscape processes, or natural hazards.
            For certain applications the limited extent of UAS-based data requires us to merge the high
            resolution topography with other data sources such as lidar. However, simple patching creates
            discontinuities or artificial edges in the merged DEMs leading to artifacts in modeling results
            and visualization. In this presentation I will show how to derive seamless digital elevation models
            combining different sources including time-series of UAS, lidar, and Kinect data, and I will
            explain how this simple, yet powerful method can be implemented in GIS.

      <p class="abstract" style="padding-top:10px;">Spatial patterns of land use change
          due to urbanization and its impact on the landscape are the subject of ongoing research.
          Urban growth scenario simulation is a powerful tool for exploring these impacts
          and empowering planners to make informed decisions. We present FUTURES
          (FUTure Urban – Regional Environment Simulation) – a patch-based,
          stochastic, multi-level land change modeling framework as a case
          showing how what was once a closed and inaccessible model benefited
          from integration with open source GIS.We will describe our motivation
          for releasing this project as open source and the advantages of integrating
          it with GRASS GIS, a free, libre and open source GIS and research platform
          for the geospatial domain. GRASS GIS provides efficient libraries for
          FUTURES model development as well as standard GIS tools and graphical
          user interface for model users. Releasing FUTURES as a GRASS GIS
          add-on simplifies the distribution of FUTURES across all main
          operating systems and ensures the maintainability of our project in the future.
          We will describe FUTURES integration into GRASS GIS and demonstrate its usage
          on a case study in Asheville, North Carolina. The developed dataset and tutorial
          for this case study enable researchers to experiment with the model,
          explore its potential or even modify the model for their applications.

          The integration of land change modeling framework FUTURES in GRASS GIS 7</a></h4>

         <p class="abstract" style="padding-top:10px;"><strong>Abstract:</strong>
Many valuable models and tools developed by scientists are often inaccessible
to their potential users because of non-existent sharing infrastructure or
lack of documentation. Case in point is the FUTure Urban-Regional Environment
Simulation (FUTURES), a patch-based land change model for generating scenario-based
regional forecasts of urban growth pattern. Despite a high-impact publication,
few scientists, planners, or policy makers have adopted FUTURES due to complexity
in use and lack of direct access. We seek to address these issues by integrating
FUTURES into GRASS GIS, a free and open source GIS and research platform for
geospatial domain. This integration will enable us to take advantage of GRASS
GIS tools for landscape structure analysis, and thus eliminate the need to use
proprietary software for data preprocessing. Moreover, integration into GRASS GIS
simplifies the distribution of FUTURES across all main operating systems and
ensures maintainability of our project in the future. We will present our use
case of integrating this advanced land change model into GRASS GIS platform and
discuss the current state of the integration as well as the planned steps to
achieve our vision of simple-to-use and fully free and open source FUTURES.

         <p class="abstract" style="padding-top:10px;"><strong>Abstract:</strong> We present
         advances in the development of TanGeoMS, tangible geospatial modeling
         and visualization system. By coupling a physical three-dimensional
         landscape model, Kinect scanner, projector, and open source GIS software suite GRASS GIS,
         we created an intuitive tangible interface for dynamic modeling of real-world
         processes in response to different terrain data inputs. How does it work?
         You modify the flexible physical model by hands while it is being scanned,
         imported and processed in GRASS GIS. After computing a desired geospatial
         analysis or dynamic simulation, the results are projected back on the physical
         model providing you with instant feedback.
        With TanGeoMS we can explore how dune breaches affect coastal flooding,
        how the spread of fire is influenced by location of firebreaks or what is
        the effectiveness of various landscape designs for controlling runoff and erosion.
        We can add buildings and assess the distribution of solar radiation for different
        building sizes and locations or explore impacts of built structures and
        trees on line of sight and viewsheds. We will cover new 3D manufacturing
        technologies and materials we use to create precise physical models and
        discuss various options for single user and collaborative system designs.
        Whether you are involved in environmental modeling, decision-making,
        education or you are just curious, you will find this talk inspiring for your own projects.

        <p class="abstract" style="padding-top:10px;"><strong>Abstract:</strong>
            Come and learn about scripting, graphical and tangible (!) interfaces for GRASS GIS,
            the powerful desktop GIS and geoprocessing backend. We will start with the
            Python interface and finish with Tangible Landscape, a new tangible interface for GRASS GIS.
            Python is the primary scripting language for GRASS GIS. We will demonstrate how to use
            Python to automate your geoprocessing workflows with GRASS GIS modules and develop
            custom algorithms using a Pythonic interface to access low level GRASS GIS library
            functions. We will also review several tips and tricks for parallelization.
            Tangible Landscape is an example of how the GRASS GIS Python API can be used
            to build new, cutting edge tools and advanced applications. Tangible Landscape
            is a collaborative 3D sketching tool which couples a 3D scanner, a projector and
            a physical 3D model with GRASS GIS. The workshop will be a truly hands-on
            experience – you will play with Tangible Landscape, using your hands to shape
            a sand model and drive geospatial processes.

      <p class="abstract" style="padding-top:10px;"><strong>Abstract:</strong>
      Spatial patterns of land use change due to urbanization and its impact on the landscape
      is the subject of ongoing research. Urban growth scenario simulation is a powerful tool
      for exploring these impacts and empowering planners to make informed decisions. In this
      workshop, we will introduce FUTURES (FUTure Urban - Regional Environment Simulation)
      - a patch-based, stochastic, multi-level land change modeling framework implemented
      in GRASS GIS 7. FUTURES is a fully open source land change modeling framework that
      accommodates multilevel drivers of land change across a heterogenous region.
      Participants will learn the concepts, input data and general workflow of the model and
      get the chance to simulate emerging landscape spatial structure in urbanizing regions
      of North Carolina. We will start with hands-on exercises in GRASS GIS, a free and open
      source scientific platform for geoprocessing. We will cover spatial processing and
      analyses of urban growth predictors such as landscape topography, hydrography, cost
      and proximity, followed by introduction to spatio-temporal data handling and visualization.
      We will also demonstrate how GRASS GIS, Python and R interfaces can be leveraged
      for developing workflows, including tips and tricks for parallelization when working
      with ‘big data’. Participants will then run urban simulations using FUTURES with
      different possible population and spatial planning scenarios. This workshop is a great
      introduction to GRASS GIS including the unique tools available in GRASS GIS Addons repository.

          How to write a Python GRASS GIS 7 addon</a></h4>
      <p>Zambelli P., Delucchi, L., Petras V., Petrasova A., Neteler M. FOSS4G Europe 2015.
        <p class="abstract" style="padding-top:10px;"><strong>Abstract:</strong>
        GRASS GIS is a leading software in analysis of geodata, it offers more than 400 modules in its core version plus many addons
        (i.e., user contributed modules). But what if the tool you are looking for
        is not present in GRASS GIS? So, simply create your own, we will show you how to do that in this workshop.
        In GRASS GIS 7, Python is the default language for creating addons.
        There are two main Python libraries included in GRASS GIS. 
        Python Scripting Library allows you to perform analysis and
        compute new data by chaining existing modules to create your own workflow.  
        With PyGRASS library wrapping the C functions, you can create new data sets (vector and raster)
        directly through Python calls, increasing considerably the power and performance of your scripts.
        You can conveniently mix both GRASS Python libraries with other Python libraries like NumPy, or SciPy.
        In this workshop, we will guide you through the basic steps of writing your own Python scripts,
        starting with calling and chaining GRASS GIS modules, followed by a more pythonic experience
        when using PyGRASS to access and modify your data directly.
        You will then upgrade your script into an addon by defining a simple interface to enable automatically
        generated GUI. The next part of workshop will look into more advanced usage of GRASS GIS 7 capabilities,
        including Python spatio-temporal API to handle time series in your addons, creating your own toolbox with your
        newly developed addons and finally, introducing the new testing framework you should use as a responsible person to make
        sure your addons are in great shape.
        This is a workshop created for FOSS4G Europe 2015.

         In this workshop, we will introduce you to GRASS GIS 7,
         including its spatio-temporal capabilities and you will learn
         how to manage and analyze geospatial data time series.
         Then, we will explore new tools for visualization of spatio-temporal data.
         You will create both 2D and 3D dynamic visualizations directly in GRASS GIS 7.
         Additionally, we will explain the Space Time Cube concept using various applications based
         on raster and vector data time series. You will learn to manage and visualize data
         in space time cubes (voxel models). No prior knowledge of GRASS GIS is necessary,
         we will cover the basics needed for the workshop. This is a workshop created for FOSS4G 2014.
